TODO:
* Pre-upload of slides
* Options 'redirectClient' and 'clientURL' on 'create'
* Option 'avatarURL' on 'join'
* 'getDefaultConfigXML' and 'setConfigXML'. They are already used when a
  user joins a meeting, to set the custom options configured in the target
  room. But these API methods cannot be called individually yet.
